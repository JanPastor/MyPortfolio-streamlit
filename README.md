# streamlit Website
The purpose of this repo is to try my hand at small scale web development using Streamlit to ease me into the process of learning HTML, CSS, and Python.
1. Note I already have an intermediate understanding of Python, C++, but I lack in depth knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
2. Plans for the future: To learn Javascript and C++ as well as full stack web development.

## Disclaimer

1. This is my humble attempt at creating my own portfolio website.

# Summer_Code_2023
The purpose of this summer code is for me, Jan Pastor, to learn as much coding as possible before summer vacation 
is over. To that end, I've set up a git hub repository for all my summer coding related projects and learning
activities. This is a private repository and can be viewed only by me.

Futher plans with Summer_Code_2023
-Learn more Python programming
-Get started with C programming for my Electrical/Computer Engineering Double Major
-Learn GO-BGC Python Data collection before the start of Summer Educational Trip MATE ROV August 20-26, 2023
